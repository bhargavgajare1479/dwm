# **Experiment 6: Clustering using WEKA (SimpleKMeans Algorithm)**

### **Steps to Perform Clustering in WEKA**

1. Open **WEKA** and click on **Explorer Mode**.  
2. Click **Open File** in the top-left corner.  
3. Navigate to the WEKA data folder (usually located at  
   `"C:\Program Files\Weka-3-8\data\"`) and select a dataset (e.g., **iris.arff**).  
4. Go to the **Cluster** tab at the top.  
5. Choose **SimpleKMeans** as the clustering algorithm.  
6. Click the **Start** button on the right to perform clustering.
