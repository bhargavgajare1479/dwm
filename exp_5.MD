# **Experiment 5: Association using WEKA (Apriori Algorithm)**

### **Steps to Perform Association in WEKA**

1. Open **WEKA** and click on **Explorer Mode**.  
2. Click **Open File** in the top-left corner.  
3. Navigate to the WEKA data folder (usually located at  
   `"C:\Program Files\Weka-3-8\data\"`) and select a dataset (e.g., **weather.nominal.arff**).  
4. Go to the **Associate** tab at the top.  
5. Choose **Apriori** as the association algorithm.  
6. Click the **Start** button on the right to generate association rules.
